# SystemVerilog Unit Test Flow

## Introduction

svut is a very simple system to create a Verilog/SystemVerilog unit test.
It is widely inspired by [SVUnit](http://agilesoc.com/open-source-projects/svunit/), 
but it's written in python and can run [Icarus Verilog]() and [Verilator] as simulator.
svut follows KISS principle: Keep It Simple, Stupid.

Hope it can help you!
